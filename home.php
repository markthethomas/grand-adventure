        <p>
          Mark and Haley met freshman year of college during their first semester. Haley thought Mark was cute right away, even though he was on crutches. They went on a GYRAD (Get-Your-Roommate-A-Date) together during their second semester and had a great time
          talking all night about every topic under the sun.
        </p>

        <p>
          After freshman year and a summer of growth, Mark decided to pursue Haley during their sophomore year. Haley didn’t want to get her hopes up so she wasn’t sure what he was up to, but his intentions became clear when he asked her to “coffee” that turned
          into a three hour dinner at their favorite APU spot, Legends. After a few more dates, they hiked up the famous Garcia Trail to the cross at the peak and Mark asked Haley to be his girlfriend.
        </p>

        <p>
          Their time dating was filled with lots of coffee, deep discussions, sloths, and even a short time apart when Haley went to Spain for a few months. It was then when Mark and Haley were apart that they realized they loved each other. Mark and Haley were
          blessed to go abroad together to Oxford, England for a few months to study, and there time there was a rainy fairytale. It was there, in the beautiful meadow of Christ Church College, that Mark got down on one knee and asked Haley to marry him.
        </p>
        <p>
          And, of course, Haley said yes!
